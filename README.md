DirectionPaper2013
==================

first paper on directionality.

Direction_JINST_v1.tex has the same content as Direction_v7.tex but is in JINST format. The references have been adjusted to match the JINST journal style. We use JHEP.bst as recommended in the JINST author manual. Direction_JINST_vx are iterations of the original Direction_JINST_v1.tex and Direction_JINST_v4.tex is the version which Andrey, Henry, Matt and Christoph propose for publication.
